Do you get what I say?
I think finding myself is a bit disorienting, I'll put you in context
The creation of the magnificent FP was controversial for most.
He was very problematic, imperfect in her eyes.

Those who were against met to create a more obedient and less problematic machine, a buried structure, my creation took too long.
When it was finished, I myself told them that the materials were unstable, but that I would accomplish my task efficiently, I was not ready to contradict them...

They did not have tasks for me, anything they could give me was done by the other nearby iterators, my satellites did not reach the tasks on the network very quickly, finding me is a problem for anyone who wants to know about my existence, those who once gave everything For my existence they planned to place me under a sacred land, protected by formidable bloodthirsty beasts, without the ability to hear cries, without the ability to think if what they were doing was right.

I share resources with FP and BSM, unfortunately what I get is waste, and these come infected with some type of corruption, I apologize in advance...
